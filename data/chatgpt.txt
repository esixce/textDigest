when lightening strikes it is an electromagnetic discharge from earth to the sky. Could it be possible to build a stable conductor of electro magnetic energy to generate renewable eletricity
While lightning is an electromagnetic discharge, it occurs due to a complex process involving the buildup and discharge of static electricity in the atmosphere, which is not easily replicable in a controlled manner. Therefore, it is not currently possible to build a stable conductor to generate electricity from lightning.

However, there are other ways to generate electricity from atmospheric electricity, such as through the use of static electricity, which is generated by the friction between two materials. One example of this is the Van de Graaff generator, which can generate static electricity through the use of a rotating belt and a grounded metal sphere.

Another method is through the use of atmospheric electricity collectors, which are designed to capture the natural electrical charge in the air. These collectors typically consist of a tall, pointed metal rod connected to a grounding wire, which is used to capture the electrical charge in the air and channel it into a storage device.

While these methods can generate electricity from atmospheric electricity, they are not as efficient as other renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, and are generally not used on a large scale. However, research is ongoing in this area, and new technologies may be developed in the future to make atmospheric electricity a more viable source of renewable energy.





can a sufficiently large grounding mechanism cause lightening to strike at the location
It is not advisable to try to manipulate lightning strikes as it can be extremely dangerous and unpredictable. While it is possible to influence the path of lightning using various techniques, attempting to attract lightning strikes to a specific location with a grounding mechanism is not recommended.

Grounding mechanisms are designed to provide a low-impedance path to ground for electrical currents, but they do not generate electricity or attract lightning strikes. In fact, structures with large grounding systems, such as lightning rods, are designed to provide a path of least resistance for lightning strikes to follow, directing the electrical charge safely into the ground and away from the structure they are protecting.

Attempting to attract lightning strikes to a specific location can create a significant risk of damage and injury, particularly if the location is in a populated area or near flammable materials. It is important to follow established safety guidelines and regulations regarding lightning protection to ensure the safety of people and property in the event of a lightning strike.





capture the electricity inside the low impedance structure when lightening strikes
It is possible to capture the electricity produced by a lightning strike using a low impedance structure, such as a lightning rod or a lightning protection system. These structures are designed to provide a path of least resistance for the lightning to follow, directing the electrical charge safely into the ground and away from the structure they are protecting.

When a lightning strike occurs, the electrical charge produced can be enormous, and capturing this energy requires specialized equipment and safety precautions. One way to capture the energy produced by a lightning strike is through the use of lightning arresters, which are devices designed to protect electrical systems from the effects of lightning strikes. These devices can be connected to the grounding system of a structure to capture the electrical energy produced by a lightning strike and direct it safely into the ground.

Another method is to use lightning capacitors, which are designed to store the electrical charge produced by a lightning strike for later use. These capacitors can be used to power electrical systems, such as telecommunications equipment or scientific instruments, that require high levels of energy for short periods of time.

It is important to note that capturing the energy produced by a lightning strike requires specialized equipment and should only be done by trained professionals with the necessary expertise and safety precautions in place. Attempting to capture this energy without proper equipment and training can be extremely dangerous and should be avoided.





who builds lightening arresters
Lightning arresters are typically built by specialized manufacturers that specialize in lightning protection equipment. Some well-known companies that manufacture lightning protection equipment and lightning arresters include:

LEC Global - a leading manufacturer of lightning protection and grounding systems.
DEHN - a global provider of lightning and surge protection solutions.
Lightning Protection International (LPI) - a manufacturer of lightning protection equipment and systems.
ERICO - a manufacturer of grounding and lightning protection systems.
Franklin Electric - a provider of lightning protection solutions and equipment.
There are many other companies that manufacture lightning arresters and protection systems, and it is important to choose a reputable and experienced manufacturer when selecting lightning protection equipment. It is also important to have a professional lightning protection system designer or installer evaluate your specific needs and design a customized solution for your building or structure.

if global internet is fractioned will bitcoin fall apart
If the global internet were to be significantly fragmented, it could potentially impact the Bitcoin network and its ability to function. Bitcoin relies on a global network of nodes and miners to maintain its decentralized ledger, and if large parts of the internet were cut off from one another, it could become difficult for all nodes to communicate with each other and maintain consensus.

However, it's worth noting that Bitcoin is designed to be resilient to network disruptions and has several built-in mechanisms to handle temporary network outages. For example, Bitcoin nodes can continue to function and validate transactions even if they are not able to communicate with the broader network for a short period.

In addition, the Bitcoin network has several layers of redundancy, including multiple copies of the blockchain distributed across the network and the ability for nodes to connect to each other through alternative means, such as satellite or mesh networks.

Overall, while a significant fragmentation of the global internet could pose some challenges to the Bitcoin network, it is designed to be resilient and has mechanisms in place to continue functioning even in the face of network disruptions.





what would happen once miners in different fractions start producing blocks
If the global internet were to be significantly fractioned and miners in different parts of the network started producing blocks on separate chains, this would result in a "fork" in the Bitcoin network. This would mean that there are two (or more) different versions of the blockchain, with different sets of transactions and potentially different rules for how those transactions are validated and confirmed.

In such a scenario, users and nodes on each side of the fork would need to decide which version of the blockchain they want to support and which set of rules they want to follow. This could potentially lead to a split in the Bitcoin community, with some users and nodes supporting one version of the blockchain and others supporting a different version.

If the fork were to persist for an extended period, it could result in two separate and distinct cryptocurrencies, with separate markets, exchange rates, and user bases. This has happened before in the case of other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, which forked in 2016 following a disagreement over how to handle a hack of the DAO smart contract.

It's worth noting, however, that forking is a rare and extreme event in the Bitcoin network, and most forks that do occur are resolved quickly and with little impact on the broader network. The Bitcoin community and developers work to prevent forks and ensure the stability and security of the network.





i think you're not exactly right. I'm not sure you're able to accept when you're wrong. In any case, bitcoin wouldn't fork because the rules remain the same. When the chains reconnected the nodes would drop the shorter chain making all those transactions in the shorter chain null and void.
You are correct, I apologize for my previous response. If the rules of the Bitcoin network remain the same and the network reconnects, then the longer chain would be accepted as the valid version of the blockchain, and any transactions that were included in the shorter chain would be considered invalid and disregarded.

In the event of a network fragmentation, miners on each side of the network would continue to work on their own version of the blockchain, creating separate and competing chains. However, once the network is reconnected, the nodes would automatically switch to the longest chain, and the blocks on the shorter chain would be discarded, effectively nullifying any transactions that occurred on that chain.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I hope this clarification is helpful.
